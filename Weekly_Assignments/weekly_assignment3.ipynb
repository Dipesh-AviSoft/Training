    "  ####    -------------------------------------------- **Tic Tac Toe Game in Python** ---------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Python program to implement a two-player Tic Tac Toe game. The game should be played in the console, and the players will take turns to make their moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Player Names:**\n",
    "Allow players to enter their names at the beginning of the game instead of using generic 'Player 1' and 'Player 2'. Display the players' names throughout the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Board Size Selection:**\n",
    "Allow users to choose the size of the game board (e.g., 4x4, 5x5) instead of the standard 3x3. Make sure to adapt the win condition check accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Symbols:**\n",
    "Let players choose their own symbols or even use non-traditional symbols. For example, they could play with letters, or any other characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Game Statistics:**\n",
    "Keep track of statistics such as the number of games played, wins for each player, and draws. Display these statistics at the end of each game or in a separate menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The game should check for valid moves and display an error message if a player attempts to make an invalid move (e.g., choosing a cell that is already occupied).**\n",
    "**The game should check for a win condition after each move to determine if a player has won.**\n",
    "**If the board is filled with no winner, the game should declare a draw.**\n",
    "**After each game, ask players if they want to play again.**\n"
