    "**Problem Statement:**\n",
    "Create a simple command-line quiz game that reads questions from a file, allows users to answer them, and provides a score at the end. The questions and answers should be stored in a text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Question class with attributes like question_text and correct_answer. Include methods to initialize the question and check if a provided answer is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**File Handling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a text file (quiz_questions.txt) to store questions and answers. Each line in the file represents a question with the format: <question_text>|<correct_answer>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Read Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a function to read questions from the file and create instances of the Question class for each question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quiz Game Loop:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a loop that presents each question to the user, allows them to input their answer, checks if it's correct, and keeps track of their score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Score Calculation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate and display the user's score at the end of the quiz.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Handling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement error handling to handle cases where the file is not found or if there is an issue reading its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Negative Marking:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are 3 wrong answers in the quiz, 1 mark will be deducted.\n",
    "There will be no negative marking for one-word answers.\n",
